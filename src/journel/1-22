i updated index.php to display the navigation based on user privilege. And fixed a few bugs to begin testing.
I also added new files not filled in yet, but these are the main pages that every use will use, and some extra pages
that are meant for the own such as seeing ever users time clock and being able to filter unpaid events and fill out
their pay, possibly their pay rate.
