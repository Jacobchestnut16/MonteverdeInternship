Today I spent most of the day trying to set up a database for the project. I had a hard time visualizing it so I spent
way too long on it. But I drew it out in DIA and was able to get a foundation for how the database can work.

    - Events the events the owner has throughout the year
    - Users login and user information
    - EventType allows the owner to have a reusable list of events // will include color for when the calendar is created
    - EventLocation allows the owner to have a reusable list of events // will include color
    - eventUsers was created for the many to many relation ship between events and users which allows the company to
        assign users to a certain shift (the ultimate goal)

    missing:
    - UserEventsRequests allows users to request to work an event
    - UserEventDrop allows the users to notify the company someone cannot work an event
    - UserCannotBeScheduledDates The dates that users cannot be scheduled for
    - UserTimeClock allows teh user to clock in and out when they are working
    - Events | features notes, foreign keys, schedule/itinerary
    - EventLocation | features color
    - EventTypes | features color
    - UsersPayRate | not official and undecided by the company | payRate, userID
