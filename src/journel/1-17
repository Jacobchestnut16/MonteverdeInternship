I have completed signup register and for the most part login.
I will add more logic to index.php when I get to logged in users and how limited the site will look for each
privilege and for users that aren't logged in yet.
I added logic for users to be requried a signup code. One generic code that the owner can give to everyone so that
they can signup on their own, and a generative code that is based on the users id so that the user can finish setting
up their account on their own. this code would also help when the user forgets their password it can get emailed to them
so that they can reset their password when needed.

next goals are to start working at the calender and adding data to the database such as event locations, event types
followed by logic for users to request shifts, and for the owner to set up schedules
